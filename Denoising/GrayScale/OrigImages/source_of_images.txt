There are 13 images in this gallery. The images need to be converted to ASCII PGM format before running our programs.
The header of the ppm file must conform to the following specs:

First line contains the pgm magic code.
Second line contains the width and height separated by a space.
Third line contains a number which is equal to the maximum values of any color in the image  (i.e. 255).
