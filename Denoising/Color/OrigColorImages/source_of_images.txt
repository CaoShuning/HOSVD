There are 24 images in this gallery. The images need to be converted to ASCII PPM format before running our programs.
The header of the ppm file must conform to the following specs:

First line contains the ppm magic code.
Second line contains the width and height separated by a space.
Third line contains a number which is equal to the maximum values of any color in the image  (i.e. 255).
